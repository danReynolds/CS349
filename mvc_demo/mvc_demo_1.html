    /*
     This code works -- we can change your excitement level with the slider.
     For such a simple application, this code is fine.

     However, as the web app gets more sophisticated, there will be more content
     and components on the screen. Retrieving elements by their ID and updating
     them in response to events can lead to unwieldy code, since the DOM is kind
     of like a global variable.

     What we'd like to do is to separate concerns and better structure our code
     so that we have smaller modules of code responsible for small, discrete chunks
     of functionality in the app.

     mvc_demo_2.html will start to move us in that direction by introducing MVC
     (again, note that this page is NOT an example of MVC).
